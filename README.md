# JuaShade: A Computer Vision Pipeline for Skin Tone Analysis and Color Constancy

## 📌 Overview
JuaShade is a graduate-level computer vision project focused on **fair and accurate skin tone analysis**.  
The pipeline addresses challenges with **lighting, glare, and bias** by combining:
- **ROI extraction** for skin patches
- **Glare removal** filters
- **Color constancy** algorithms
- **Baseline ML (SVM, kNN)** and **advanced CNN classifiers (ResNet, EfficientNet)**
- **GAN-based enhancement** for realistic preprocessing

The goal is to improve inclusivity and fairness in AI systems used for dermatology, cosmetology, and facial recognition.
