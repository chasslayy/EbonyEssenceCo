# JuaShade: A Computer Vision Pipeline for Skin Tone Analysis and Color Constancy  

## üìå Overview  
**JuaShade** is a computer vision project designed to improve **fair and accurate skin tone analysis**.  
Traditional vision systems often misinterpret skin tones due to **lighting variations, glare, and dataset bias**.  

This project develops a pipeline that:  
- Extracts **skin regions of interest (ROI)**  
- Removes **glare and reflections**  
- Applies **color constancy algorithms** to standardize lighting  
- Compares **classical ML models (SVM, kNN)** with **deep learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet)**  
- Explores **GAN-based enhancement** for preprocessing  

The goal is to create a more **inclusive AI system** that improves reliability for applications in **dermatology, cosmetics, and computer vision fairness research**.
