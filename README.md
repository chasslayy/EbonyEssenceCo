# JuaShade: A Computer Vision Pipeline for Skin Tone Analysis and Color Constancy  

## 📌 Overview  
**JuaShade** is a computer vision project that focuses on **fair and accurate skin tone analysis**. Traditional vision systems often misinterpret skin tones due to lighting variations, glare, and dataset bias. JuaShade addresses these challenges by building a pipeline that:  

- Extracts skin regions of interest (ROI)  
- Removes glare and reflections from images  
- Applies **color constancy** algorithms to standardize lighting  
- Compares classical ML methods (SVM, kNN) with deep learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet)  
- Explores **GAN-based enhancement** to improve preprocessing  

The goal of JuaShade is to contribute to **inclusive AI** by improving the reliability of skin tone recognition for applications in dermatology, cosmetics, and computer vision fairness research.

# JuaShade: A Computer Vision Pipeline for Skin Tone Analysis and Color Constancy

## 📌 Overview
JuaShade is a graduate-level computer vision project focused on **fair and accurate skin tone analysis**.  
The pipeline addresses challenges with **lighting, glare, and bias** by combining:
- **ROI extraction** for skin patches
- **Glare removal** filters
- **Color constancy** algorithms
- **Baseline ML (SVM, kNN)** and **advanced CNN classifiers (ResNet, EfficientNet)**
- **GAN-based enhancement** for realistic preprocessing

The goal is to improve inclusivity and fairness in AI systems used for dermatology, cosmetology, and facial recognition.
